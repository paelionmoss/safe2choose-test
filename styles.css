/* There are a couple of things I would do to make the page look better. First, I personally
 * don't like the cream color of the page's background and would prefer to change it to something
 * darker. More importantly, on a regular computer screen there is too much blank space. I would
 * move the "Contact Us" and "Find out more..." sections to take more advantage of horizontal space
 * and so as not to have them dangling below by themselves. I think the spaces between sections are 
 * unnecessary and just take up more room. I would also integrate the black bars at the top and
 * bottom into the page itself.
